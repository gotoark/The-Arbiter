# The Arbiter Project Standards

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components

## File Organization
- Components in `src/components/`
- Utilities in `src/lib/`
- Types in `src/types/`
- API routes in `src/app/api/`

## Development Guidelines
- Write clean, readable code
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused
